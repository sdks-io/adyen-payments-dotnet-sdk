The result of the payment. For more information, see [Result codes](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/payment-result-codes).

Possible values:

* **AuthenticationFinished** – The payment has been successfully authenticated with 3D Secure 2. Returned for 3D Secure 2 authentication-only transactions.

* **Authorised** – The payment was successfully authorised. This state serves as an indicator to proceed with the delivery of goods and services. This is a final state.
* **Cancelled** – Indicates the payment has been cancelled (either by the shopper or the merchant) before processing was completed. This is a final state.

  This happens for card payments when the merchant supports Partial Authorisations and the cardholder has insufficient funds.
