| `OwnerName` | `string` | Optional | The name of the bank account holder.<br>If you submit a name with non-Latin characters, we automatically replace some of them with corresponding Latin characters to meet the FATF recommendations. For example:<br><br>* χ12 is converted to ch12.<br>* üA is converted to euA.<br>* Peter Møller is converted to Peter Mller, because banks don't accept 'ø'.<br>  After replacement, the ownerName must have at least three alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), and at least one of them must be a valid Latin character (A-Z, a-z). For example:<br>* John17 - allowed.<br>* J17 - allowed.<br>* 171 - not allowed.<br>* John-7 - allowed.<br><br>> If provided details don't match the required format, the response returns the error message: 203 'Invalid bank account holder name'. |
